# connecting/creating a database
- connecting to a non-existent database with sqlite-3 will create a database in the following directory.
- we can create one by using memory but as soon as the program closes, the database gets deleted. 
- memory database can be used later if there is something temporary we want to deal with.
- run the file 'database.py' or whatever name, if no database is found it will create a database within
  the directory.
  command: python3 'database.py'


# creating a table
- rows and columns same as other database like spreadsheets, excel
- create a cursor
- cursor is something what we want to tell the database to do
- commit command to the database
- close connection after creating a connection

# data types in sqlite
- NULL
- INTEGER
- REAL
- TEXT
- BLOB


#insert one record into table
