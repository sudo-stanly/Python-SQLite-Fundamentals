# connecting/creating a database
- connecting to a non-existent database with sqlite-3 will create a database in the following directory.
- we can create one by using memory but as soon as the program closes, the database gets deleted. 
- memory database can be used later if there is something temporary we want to deal with.
- run the file 'database.py' or whatever name, if no database is found it will create a database within
  the directory.
  command: python3 'database.py'


# creating a table
- rows and columns same as other database like spreadsheets, excel
- create a cursor
- cursor is something what we want to tell the database to do
- commit command to the database
- close connection after creating a connection

# data types in sqlite
- NULL
- INTEGER
- REAL
- TEXT
- BLOB


#insert one record into table
- execute a command that inserts value into table, by inserting a record into table
  we must match the number of columns to insert our values in.
  command: c.execute("INSERT INTO customers VALUE('first_name', 'last_name', 'email')")


#inserting many records into table
- create a variable list with tuple as items inside the list, the fill the values for each column
  after creating the list, add the variable after the insertion command, fill the columns with 
  question marks to bypass, use the execute many command to insert many records.
  many_customers = [(..., ...,), (...,...), (...,...)]
  command: c.executemany("INSERT INTO customers VALUES(?,?,?), many_customers)


#query and fetchall
- query the database by using select command
- to get the data use fetchone, or fetchmany how many we want, or fetchall
  query command: c.execute("SELECT * ALL FROM customers")
- wrap the fetch command in a print function
  print(c.fetchall())

  
#format results
- each item is numbered like indexing
- format the output using for loop


#primary key id
- sqlite creates another column of row id for each row of data


#where clause
use where and like clauses or operators for better querying


#update records
- when updating a record, use primary key id
