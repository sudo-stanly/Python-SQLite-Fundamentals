SQLite Coursework

This repository is a collection of everything Iâ€™ve worked on while learning SQLite
from creating databases and tables to performing queries and integrating them with Python.
It serves as a record of my progress in understanding how data is stored, managed, and accessed efficiently.

Purpose
    Document my journey of learning SQLite step by step.
    Keep track of basic database operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting data (CRUD).
    Combine guided learning (tutorials, examples) with self-paced exploration (practice exercises and small projects).

Build a personal reference for database design and SQL queries that I can revisit anytime.
