# create functions
- take all command in a function that we can call from other file

note:
since we're implementing inside of directories we will use:
  - by adding __init__.py the folder is considered a pacakge
  - use command: python -m app.our_app
  in terminal to access other file as pacakages
  -m is a flag, that flags the folder as a pacakge and ables to access other sibling folder
  'app' is the folder name 'our_app' is the file

but if we're just creating everything without subfolder directory, we can simply run python file.py from the
root directory


#add a record function
- by creating an add function to add one record at a time


#deleting one record from a table
- use primary key id
- since we're passing a parameter, the key must be passed as a string and the command will translate it
  as a number
- when passing to this parameter, convert to string instead or writing double quotes


#adding many records in table
- since we're passing a list with items of tuples, in database.py the list parameter
  is passed inside the execution command
